Resources to support cross curricula learning
## Contents
1. Worksheets for maths teachers that make use of scientific concepts
2. Posters with Science equations to put up around school
3. List of GCSE physics equations
4. STEM Key Words / 1000 most common english words

## Details
1. The concept behind these is that maths teachers will be practising the concept of, for example, substiuting into formulae in their lessons. However, often, they will use randomly generated formulae that have no meaning. It would be useful for pupils if maths teachers used the equations that pupils are expected to be familiar with in their Science lessons. The more experience pupils have with these the beeter able they will be to remember them and use them effectively. These worksheets are designed to reinforce scientific concepts in maths lessons.
2. To further reinforce the equations used in Science lessons the idea with these posters is that they should be part of the display for learning in maths classrooms. 
3. This list of equations is intended for maths teachers to familiarise themselves with the equations used in Science lessons.  They can use these when teaching concepts such as rearranging formulae, substitution into formulae etc.
4. These are used for my activity explaining STEM concepts using only the top 1000 words in the English language
